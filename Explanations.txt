The code below is for creating, setting and getting an object using the normal way.
The code is long and involves multiple steps

$stefan = new person();
$jimmy = new person();

$stefan->set_name("Stefan Mischook");
$jimmy->set_name("Nick Waddles");

echo "Stefan's full name is ". $stefan->get_name(). "<br/>";
echo "Nicks's full name is ". $jimmy->get_name(). "<br/>";

Note: directly accessing properties in a class is a no-no.
echo "Stefan's full name: " . $stefan->name;



The code below is for the above process but using constructors. The code is shorter and therfore there is less code to debug.
 creating an object with constructors
 $stefan = new person("Stefan Mischook");
  
 showed from using constructor
 echo "Stefan's full name: " . $stefan->get_name();


 You restrict access to class properties using something called 'access modifiers'. This is in order to achieve encapsulation
There are 3 access modifiers:
• public
• private
• protected
Public is the default modifier. 
Note: When you declare a property with the 'var' keyword, it is considered 'public'. 

When you declare a property as 'private', only the same class can access the
property.
When a property is declared 'protected', only the same class and classes derived
from that class can access the property - this has to do with inheritance …more on
that later.
Properties declared as 'public' have no access restrictions, meaning anyone can
access them.
